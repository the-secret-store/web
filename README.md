# The Secret Store

The Secret Store is a platform to share and synchronize your project configuration environment variables with your team without having to send a bunch of e-mails back and forth with simple commands like in git.

It's Forever FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). You can fork and create your copy, and utilize it for your personal/commercial use within your organization.

## cli

This is the CLI of the secret store. Since the [API](https://github.com/the-secret-store/api) is written in JavaScript, it's hellishly hard to manage ðŸ™‚. But don't worry TypeScript lovers, I got you covered. To make the entire application, including API, CLI, and the web client more manageable and interdependent, I'm putting together a [monorepo](https://github.com/the-secret-store/monorepo), with API written in Nest JS (TypeScript). I'm not sure where the web client is headed to, I had plans to switch to Angular, but I'm not sure about it RN.

Subscribe to the repository if you're excited. I'll update the docs asap.
